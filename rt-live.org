\cite[Online peer-reviewed journal]{Bettencourt:08}

In any epidemic, $R_t$ is the measure known as the effective reproduction
number. It's the number of people who become infected per infectious person at
time $t$. The most well-known version of this number is the basic reproduction
number: $R_0$ when $t=0$. However, $R_0$ is a single measure that does not
adapt with changes in behavior and restrictions.

As a pandemic evolves, increasing restrictions (or potential releasing of
restrictions) changes $R_t$. Knowing the current $R_t$ is essential. When
$R\gg1$, the pandemic will spread through a large part of the population. If
$R_t<1$, the pandemic will slow quickly before it has a chance to infect many
people. The lower the $R_t$: the more manageable the situation. In general,
any $R_t<1$ means things are under control.

The value of $R_t$ helps us in two ways. (1) It helps us understand
how effective our measures have been controlling an outbreak
and (2) it gives us vital information about whether we should
increase or reduce restrictions based on our competing goals of
economic prosperity and human safety. [Well-respected epidemiologists
argue](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/opinion/coronavirus-end-social-distancing.html)
that tracking $R_t$ is the only way to manage through this crisis.

Yet, today, we don't yet use $R_t$ in this way. In fact,
the only real-time measure I've seen has been for [Hong
Kong](https://covid19.sph.hku.hk/dashboard). More importantly, it is not
useful to understand $R_t$ at a national level. Instead, to manage this crisis
effectively, we need a local (state, county and/or city) granularity of $R_t$.

What follows is a solution to this problem at the US State level. It's a
modified version of a solution created by \cite{Bettencourt:08} to estimate
real-time $R_t$ using a Bayesian approach. While this paper estimates a
static $R$ value, here we introduce a process model with Gaussian noise to
estimate a time-varying $R_t$.

If you have questions, comments, or improvments feel free to get in touch:
[hello@systrom.com](mailto:hello@systrom.com). And if it's not entirely clear,
I'm not an epidemiologist. At the same time, data is data, and statistics
are statistics and this is based on work by well-known epidemiologists so
you can calibrate your beliefs as you wish. In the meantime, I hope you can
learn something new as I did by reading through this example. Feel free to
take this work and apply it elsewhere â€“ internationally or to counties in
the United States.

Additionally, a huge thanks to [Frank
Dellaert](http://www.twitter.com/fdellaert/) who suggested the addition
of the process and to [Adam Lerer](http://www.twitter.com/adamlerer/) who
implemented the changes. Not only did I learn something new, it made the
model much more responsive.
